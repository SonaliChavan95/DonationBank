# HelpingHands

## Read [installation guide](https://github.com/helpinghands2/helping_hands/wiki/Installation#installation) for setting up the app on local

### People are always up to support a good cause, but most are put off by the hassle it entails. Today, most people are caught up with their own lives and need a better way of helping the less fortunate. Like all other activities, a more efficient platform might even stimulate more frequent donations to the needy.

### Often, people that don't have enough money to donate want to contribute by giving out goods, but there are very limited avenues for easily donating goods in a manner that ensures

### 1. The donations reach the people that most need it

### 2. Minimization of wastage

### Our application hopes to efficiently solve these problems. This app will act as a middleman between the Donors(the generous) and the Recipients(the needy)

### Donors will sign up on our platform and register as donors. Once they are validated and login, they will be given accessibility to create “donation(s)”

### Recipients will be the needy; they will log on to the website to view the listed items and contact the donors for receiving the listed donation
