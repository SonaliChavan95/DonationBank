        We're here to make the world a better place, 1 smile at a time!

      <p>
        We are here to help those that need the most help, reach the ones that need help.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a donor, we empower you to make sure that the things you don't need anymore reach someone that
        needs it, and doesn't end up as waste in a landfill.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you join us as a recipient, you can look for things you need using our advanced search feature.
        We also offer you a convenient way to save your requested items: in the cart; come back to it
        anytime -- as long as it hasn't been snapped up by anyone else.
      </p>
